# generator_auto_start
Status.<br>
This Repository only started and is not compleetb yet<br>
This repository will have att the details of how I have build an Remote controllable Generator Auto start capability.<br>
I wanted to have the capability to start my Petrol Generator when we have Power outage at my hous.<br>
Sins we now have regular Load shedding in South Africa it has become a real problem to keep my webservers up and running<br>
I needed a system to auto start an electric start Petrol Generator when the City power goes down as my UPS can only keep the servers running for a short while.<br>
I desided to split the implimentation in two.<br>
One to start the Generator and the other to stop the Generator.<br>
This repository will only have the Generator start documentation.<br>
The Generator stop details will be holed in the following repository. https://github.com/antonjan/automatic_power_transfer_system <br>
I wanted to modes.<br>
One to autostart when ever the City Power is down.<br>
Two Only Start the generator when I give a command remotely.<br>
## Automatically start when City Power is down.
